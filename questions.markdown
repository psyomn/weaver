*If the fabric of reality is separate from a tear what happens to it?*

It's an interesting idea if only because it adds a bit more depth to the job (duty?) that he's performing. Sometimes the only way to close a ragged wound is by cleaning up the edges. 

In a particularly vicious tear it's possible that he might need to clean up those edges. What happens to those pieces when they're sheared off? 

I really the idea that they're linked back to the time and place that they were separated from. While the rift heals this little piece is forever trapped, separated from where it originated. 

*How do we make the list of dead people visual?*

I like the idea of tattoos, but I think that's out of context for what you're going for here. That necessitates some other options.

The thread and needle can't be seen by anyone but him and (presumably) some antagonist(s).

So, moving out on a tangent here, the longer a rip is open the larger and more ragged it becomes. In those instances where he's failed to act it would be a big and messy job to clean it up after the fact. Given that there's an expectation that people have died because of these negligences perhaps his reminder / memento is something he's woven from those scraps of reality. Something he wears that no one else can see.

*Is the weaver actually the hero?*

Maybe he is. Maybe he's not. If he's not, then why not?

There's a possibility here that reality isn't the limited scale we consider it to be. Rips in reality are just passageways to other realities. Perhaps it's only dangerous to cross for the same reason that mountain passes used to be; a simple funnel point where all traffic could be directed into the bad guys. 

The weaver is actually working against the reconciliation of realities. Our own reality long segregated from the rest. His counter part(s) are working to open as many pathways as they can in an attempt to let our reality reconnect with the multiverse. 

Which leads further down the hole to...

*Why was this reality segregated?*

*Who set the weaver on his task to keep it segregated?*

*What does failure and success look like from the weaver?*

*Which costs more: repairing a rip or tearing one in the first place?*

This intrigues me. If tearing a rip is significantly more taxing than repairing one it sets up the weaver being able to repair holes and overcome enemies. 

I like the idea that they can open holes with an invocation, a word or phrase. The way the weaver defeats them is to sew their mouths closed while they're weakened.
