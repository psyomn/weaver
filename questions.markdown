# Questions

*What is our target length?*

The desired length of the final product dictates a lot about how much story
needs to be plotted.

I'm leaning towards limiting the scope and if it's really short (to be defined
later) then maintain a fairly linear structure.

I also think it might be worth doing a small POC. Either with an isolated 
segment from this project or an entirely separate project. It should be a 
required prerequisite to moving forward with this as a larger project.

*If the fabric of reality is separated from a tear what happens to it?*

It's an interesting idea if only because it adds a bit more depth to the job
(duty?) that he's performing. Sometimes the only way to close a ragged wound is
by cleaning up the edges.

In a particularly vicious tear it's possible that he might need to clean up
those edges. What happens to those pieces when they're sheared off?

I really the idea that they're linked back to the time and place that they were
separated from. While the rift heals this little piece is forever trapped,
separated from where it originated.

*How do we make the list of dead people visual?*

I like the idea of tattoos, but I think that's out of context for what you're
going for here. That necessitates some other options.

The thread and needle can't be seen by anyone but him and (presumably) some
antagonist(s).

So, moving out on a tangent here, the longer a rip is open the larger and more
ragged it becomes. In those instances where he's failed to act it would be a big
and messy job to clean it up after the fact. Given that there's an expectation
that people have died because of these negligences perhaps his reminder /
memento is something he's woven from those scraps of reality. Something he wears
that no one else can see.

> I really like this. Maybe a part of reality on his own flesh? :D

*Is the weaver actually the hero?*

Maybe he is. Maybe he's not. If he's not, then why not?

> Does. I'm open also.

There's a possibility here that reality isn't the limited scale we consider it
to be. Rips in reality are just passageways to other realities. Perhaps it's
only dangerous to cross for the same reason that mountain passes used to be; a
simple funnel point where all traffic could be directed into the bad guys.

> Awesome.

The weaver is actually working against the reconciliation of realities. Our own
reality long segregated from the rest. His counter part(s) are working to open
as many pathways as they can in an attempt to let our reality reconnect with the
multiverse.

Which leads further down the hole to...

*Why was this reality segregated?*

The unnamed closed it off for the same reason all dictators close off their borders.
To maintain absolute authority and control. To maintain his perfect little feeding
ground where he could grow undisturbed. Where he could remove outside influences.
Where he was invisible.

*Who set the weaver on his task to keep it segregated?*

> Will be thinking on this.

*What does failure and success look like from the weaver?*

I think, at least initially, that failure looks like someone slipping through the
void. Anyone he is unable to actually prevent from either going in voluntarily 
or being drawn in.

*Which costs more: repairing a rip or tearing one in the first place?*

This intrigues me. If tearing a rip is significantly more taxing than repairing
one it sets up the weaver being able to repair holes and overcome enemies.

I like the idea that they can open holes with an invocation, a word or phrase.
The way the weaver defeats them is to sew their mouths closed while they're
weakened.

> I really like this.

*Where is the setting of the story?*

I was actually thinking of some isolated place in the north with limited
daylight and which is full of snow. This makes it a little hard to work with the
story though. A Better suggestion I personally believe would be to make the
story take place in some down-town area. The provides the chance of more
dialogue with random oddballs.

*So the threads... Where do those come from?*

We need it to take a toll on him. Let's make the act of closing a rip a blood
offering. He pricks his finger and threads the needle with his blood.

*Who is our antagonist?*

I'm calling her voidmaker prime. 

*The unnamed?*

Yeah. 

Naming the categorization, the particularization of things. It's how we 
organize and understand things. To be unnamed is to be uncategorized. To be 
beyond understanding and able to maintain power.

He's been driven from other realities. This reality that he's walled off is
the one he's feeding off of to gain power.

He sent the weaver out to do his bidding. The task that he sent him on not
worthy of the unnamed's attention. He set the weaver on his way and then 
promptly moved on to other things.

*If we go with this, what's the ending?*

He needs to go back and confront the unnamed.

1. he defies the unnamed and in takes his power in naming him
2. he goes back to work, endless closing voids and destroying voidmakers
3. he defies the unnamed and goes to back to life his own life

Number 2 is the Sisyphean ending and could be an endless loop for the player.
Banished from the presence of the unnamed and compelled to keep working against
the voidmakers.

The third pulls the weaver out of the story as the unnamed goes on his own
quest against the voidmakers, razing the world in the process as they take the
nuclear option against him... trying to create an entire reality of voidmakers
to counter him

*And conversely, what is the opening?*

I like the idea of opening on the weaver closing a void. This is his task and the
player's primary task. The expected mechanic is the first thing introduced.

*Voidmakers?*

Yeah. I think they should all be women. Natural magic to liberate this reality.

I'm sure they don't call themselves voidmakers and would have a more positive
term for themselves.

*Who is the primary antagonist?*

I'm calling her voidmaker prime. Someone who has left this reality and then
come back. She's walked the multiverse and comes back with a lot of knowledge.
She's come back knowing much about the unnamed and wants to liberate her home
reality.

The first time the weaver sees her she dives back into the void. He believes
she's lost until he encounters her later. She's stronger than the rest. She 
can create a void and not be significantly weakened by it


*What would be the next step for the unnamed?*

Let's say he was successful and bled this reality dry. Then what?

*Miscellaneous Content (Mostly Dialogue)*

And then he sent you, his little messiah, out to mind the fences.

I can tell you his name...

I know who you are. You're my maker and my warden.
You are the butcher, slowly allowing an entire reality to dance 
themselves to death in your private little slaughter.
I don't need to speak your name because I know your sins.
You are my father.

What beautiful magic there must be in your seed.
An allusion to him being the progeny of the unnamed.

Have you ever considered what would happen if you left the tear?

There were only a few of us.
When I left there were dozens.
I return to find there are hundreds.
Tomorrow there'll be even more.
And the day after.
And then the day after that. 
There is only so long you can contain us.
Only so long you can force us to behave.
