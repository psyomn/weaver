# Enter Weaver

The cold pierced any sort of clothing I wore. But it's not as if I really
prepared myself for the freezing temperatures of the current location. I took s
brief look to the night sky and squinted as the snow was being blown violently
to the winds direction. The sky was littered with lights, yet unfamiliar. The
constellations in the sky were vastly different from what I usually saw - I was
probably somewhere far away, under strange skies.

Looking back down, I spotted the reason I was here: the tear. A little higher
than the ground, but not high enough to hide the horizon from my sight, was a
black region which hid the delicate white snow and the starry night. This is the
reason I was here.

I don't know what exists in these tears, why they exist, or even how they come
to be. I don't even remember when I first started and how I even knew how to
close them. I have lived enough to see what happens if I don't seal them. People
go missing.
