# Setting

Present day (2014). Nothing out of the ordinary, apart from the supernatural
additions defined below.

# People

*Weaver (character. need name. I like common names)*:
- early 30s

- is a weaver - one who sews, and maintains the fabrics of reality

- weaving is done with a gold needle and silver thread

- the above is not visible to others

- escaped home on an early age

- used weaving abilities to survive

- maintains a list of dead people as a form of "don't forget". Dead people
  because didn't sew the void back together once

- weaving simple things together does not pose harm, however more complex, and
  more involved weaving has detrimental effects to the weaver.

*Elektra*:
- Meets up with Weaver
- husbando deceased? Whatever. So ronry need romance.

*Mini Elektra (todo: need a name)*:
- is daughter of Elektra

*The Others*:
- Invisible while in the void because everything is dark. The only thing that
  you can see are their yellow, glowing cat-like-eyes.

- Are trying to invade reality (?)

- unoticed by Weaver until much later in the story

- first encounter, Weaver notices millions of yellow stars inside the void,
  commenting that it looks 'pretty' unaware of the horrors that the void hides.
  Later on, it is revealed that it was in fact the glowing of many of the
  other's eyes inside the void.

- they are trying to break into the world in weakened places of the given world
  (TODO: how were they weakened?)

- First confrontration is when Weaver finds a much bigger breach in reality.
  Weaver notices the eyes, and is initially shocked, and in horror - all these
  years he has not seen anything like this. Starts sewing the fabrics shut, and
  after a idle time on the part of the others, they start pushing their claws
  into reality. Weaver has to push them back inside while weaving. This is one
  of the times we'll show Weaver have the horrible side effects of over-using his
  ability.
